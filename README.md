# 🤔 Guess the Word! 🤔

Just a fun little word-guessing game I built to practice my Python and Streamlit skills. Give it a try!

## Play the Game! 🎈

You can play the live version right here:

## How to Play

It's the classic word game! Try to guess the secret word, one letter at a time, before you run out of attempts.

## How It's Made

This simple demo was put together with:
* 🐍 **Python** for the game logic
* ✨ **Streamlit** to quickly create the web user interface

## What's Next? 🚀

While this Streamlit version was fun and fast to build, my plan is to use this project as a launchpad for learning more.

In the future, I intend to rebuild this game from the ground up using a traditional web stack:
* A proper backend API (probably with **Flask**).
* A custom frontend built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
